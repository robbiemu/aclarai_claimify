{"context_text": "That narrative form naturally produces sentences that rely on antecedent context: pronouns (it, they, he, she), temporal references (\"later\", \"the following year\", \"three days later\"), and comparative/relational phrases (\"the previous strategy\", \"this approach\", \"those results\"). Such sentences require disambiguation to be interpreted correctly, which matches the strategic focus for generating Self-containment examples. Tutorialspoint case-study pages are typically structured into several sections (background/history, challenges, responses, outcomes, analysis) producing many short-to-medium length paragraphs. Each section tends to introduce actors, dates, decisions, and consequences, then continues to refer to them with pronouns and implicit temporal pointers.
