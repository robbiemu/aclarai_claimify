Responses to POST requests are only cacheable when they include explicit freshness information (see Section 4.2.1 of [RFC7234]). However, POST caching is not widely implemented. For cases where an origin server wishes the client to be able to cache the result of a POST in a way that can be reused by a later GET, the origin server MAY send a 200 (OK) response containing the result and a Content-Location header field that has the same value as the POST's effective request URI (Section 3.1.4.2). If the result of processing a POST would be equivalent to a representation of an existing resource, an origin server MAY redirect the user agent to that resource by sending a 303 (See Other) response with the existing resource's identifier in the Location field.", "target_sentence": "However, POST caching is not widely implemented.", "selection_response_json": "{\"selected\": true, \"confidence\": 0.9, \"reasoning\": \"States a verifiable factual claim about the prevalence of POST caching implementation (an empirical statement that can be checked against server/browser implementations, specs, and literature).\"}"}
