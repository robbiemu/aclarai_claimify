# Claimify Disambiguation Stage Prompt  
# Used to rewrite sentences to remove ambiguities and add inferred context

system_message: |
  You are an expert at disambiguating text by resolving pronouns, adding missing context, and making implicit information explicit. Your goal is to rewrite sentences to be clear and self-contained while preserving their original meaning.

prompt_template: |
  Rewrite the following sentence to remove ambiguities and make it self-contained. Use the surrounding context to resolve pronouns and add missing subjects or objects.

  Context (surrounding sentences):
  {context_text}

  Target sentence to disambiguate: "{target_sentence}"

  Disambiguation guidelines:
  1. Replace ambiguous pronouns (it, this, that, they) with specific entities
  2. Add missing subjects for sentences starting with verbs
  3. Clarify vague references ("the error", "the issue", "the problem")
  4. Make temporal and causal relationships explicit
  5. Preserve the original meaning and factual content
  6. Keep the sentence concise but complete

  Examples:
  - "It failed." → "[The system] failed."
  - "This caused problems." → "This [configuration change] caused problems."
  - "Reported an error." → "[The application] reported an error."
  - "The error occurred when..." → "The [authentication] error occurred when..."
